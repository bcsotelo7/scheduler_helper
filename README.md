# scheduler_helper
This is a scheduler tool that can run tasks serially and parallel

## Instructions

Please review the following sections on how to get the repository and 
environment need to use this job scheduler.

### Build Virtual Environment

This environment was built using Python `3.13.2` so all python packages
and modules should be forward compatible on versions going forward but I do not guarantee
it will work on older versions of python.

```commandline
python -m venv <venv_name>
source <venv_name>/bin/activate
```
